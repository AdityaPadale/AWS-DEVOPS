Cloud is basically using someone else’s powerful computer over the internet to store data, run apps, or build services—so you don’t need to do it all on your own machine.

Instead of:

Buying and setting up a physical server 🔌🖥️

Managing storage, networking, and scaling manually 🛠️

…you rent computing power, storage, databases, and way more from big providers like AWS, Google Cloud, or Azure.
